% The dissertation must be accompanied by an abstract which will be published
% in Dissertation Abstracts International. The abstract should, in a concise
% manner, present the problem of the dissertation, discuss the materials and
% procedure or methods used, and state the results or conclusions. Mathematical
% formulas, diagrams, and other illustrative materials should be avoided. The
% abstract should not be part of the dissertation itself nor should it be
% included in the table of contents. The abstract should be presented in two
% unnumbered loose copies. It should be headed as follows:
% 
% Abstract of (TITLE OF DISSERTATION), by (AUTHOR'S NAME), Ph.D., Brown
% University, May (YEAR IN WHICH DEGREE IS TO BE AWARDED).
% 
% The abstract should be prepared carefully since it will be published without
% editing or revision. The abstract should be double-spaced and may not exceed
% 350 words (maximum 2,450 typewritten characters — including spaces and
% punctuation — about 70 characters per line with a maximum of 35 lines). If
% the 350-word limit is exceeded, University Microfilms will simply cut off the
% abstract at this point.
